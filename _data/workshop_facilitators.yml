    Joshua B. Barbour (Ph.D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) is an assistant professor of Communication Studies and affiliate faculty with the Center for Health Communication at the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin. He studies the confluence of the <a href="http://www.macromorphic.com/">macromorphic</a> and communicative in organizational life. He focuses on the difficult conversations that professionals have at work such as deliberating about organizational and technological change, questioning another expert's judgement, and interpreting organizational data to make decisions. His research is concerned with how organizations manage information and make meaning and how research can (re)design communication to help them do so with more sophistication, and it reflects the assumption that by changing how we communicate with one another we can work together more equitably and more effectively. His current and past projects include engaged scholarship in organizations where the management and interplay of information and meaning have important societal consequences such as a toxic waste storage facility, nuclear power plants, disaster preparation groups, and healthcare organizations. His work has appeared in <i>Communication Research</i>, <i>Communication Monographs</i>, <i>Communication Theory</i>, <i>Health Communication</i>, <i>the Journal of Health Communication</i>, <i>the Journal of Applied Communication Research</i>, <i>the Journal of Communication</i>, and <i>Management Communication Quarterly</i>
