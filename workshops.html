             <h3>Storytelling and Organizing</h3>
             <p class="text-center animated hiding" data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay="0">
               <q>&quot;Narratives do not simply inform organization members about the values, practices, and traditions to which their organization is committed. Rather, they help to constitute the organizational consciousness of social actors by articulating and embodying
               a particular reality&quot; (Mumby, 1987, p. 125)</q>

               Thirty years ago Dennis Mumby (1987) positioned storytelling as the coin and currency of organizational life, and narrative theory as a meaningful way to understand organizing.  This workshop will explore narrative as a theoretical frame, analytic material, representational form, and site of intervention in organizational communication scholarship. Facilitators will reflect on the promise and perils of storytelling in organizational communication scholarship. Participants will have hands-on opportunities to create and engage narrative artifacts. Workshop dialogue and activities will be informed by but not limited to the following questions:
               <br />
               <br />
               <ul class="text-left">

                 <li>How can organizational communication researchers locate narrative sense-making in action?</li>
                 <li>How can researchers create conditions for embodied and imaginative storytelling among participants?</li>
                 <li>What does storytelling do for research participants?</li>
                 <li>How can researchers anchor and shape analyses from a narrative perspective?</li>
                 <li>How can researchers narratively represent the everyday sights, sounds, spaces, and experiences of organizing?</li>
                 <li>How can research and creative activity shift and/or enlarge the storytelling resources of organizations?</li>
                 <li>How can scholarship empower its participants to collaboratively explore and develop narratives to understand and navigate mundane and disruptive challenges?</li>
                 <li>How can storytelling extend the reach of our work to general publics?</li>
               </ul>
